# Optional Skills Catalog

Official optional skills ship with the hermes-agent repository under `optional-skills/` but are **not active by default**. Install them explicitly:

```bash
hermes skills install official/<category>/<skill>
```

For example:

```bash
hermes skills install official/blockchain/solana
hermes skills install official/mlops/flash-attention
```

Once installed, the skill appears in the agent's skill list and can be loaded automatically when relevant tasks are detected.

To uninstall:

```bash
hermes skills uninstall <skill-name>
```
